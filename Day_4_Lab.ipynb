        "# Self supervised Learning Lab\n",
        "\n",
        "This lab focuses on self-supervised contrastive learning, a method for extracting meaningful features from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning avoids the need for manual labeling by leveraging patterns and differences within the data itself, enabling models to adapt quickly to downstream tasks. For instance, in autonomous driving, large datasets can be collected by mounting a camera in a car, saving significant time and cost compared to manual annotation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent advancements in self-supervised learning, particularly in contrastive learning, have demonstrated impressive performance with minimal labeled data. Contrastive learning trains models to cluster augmented versions of an image while maximizing their separation from other images. A notable method, SimCLR, uses augmentations like cropping, noise, and blurring, combined with a CNN (e.g., ResNet), to produce robust feature representations. (figure credit - [Ting Chen et al.](https://simclr.github.io/)).\n",

        "\n",
        "The framework involves creating augmented versions of unlabeled images, processing them through a network, and training the outputs to align closely for augmented pairs while diverging for unrelated images. This helps the model focus on invariant content, such as objects, that are essential for downstream tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lab will compare downstream task performance between:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A model trained using feature extractor initialized with SimCLR-pretrained feature extractors (trained in a self-supervised manner).\n",
        "- A model trained using feature extractor initialized with fully supervised training (e.g., on a labeled dataset like ImageNet).\n",
        "\n",
        "This comparison evaluates the effectiveness of SimCLR-pretrained features and their ability to serve as a foundation for task-specific fine-tuning, offering an efficient alternative to fully supervised training.\n",
        "\n",
        "This lab is heavily inspired by and adapted from the labs provided in the \"Lecture Series on Deep Learning\" at the University of Amsterdam."

        "### t-SNE Plot for Visualizing Feature Representations\n",
        "\n",
        "This code generates **t-SNE plots** to visualize and compare feature representations of the **test set** learned through two different training approaches: **SimCLR (self-supervised)** and **Supervised training**. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimensionality reduction technique that projects high-dimensional features into a 2D space for visualization. Here's what the code does:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Feature Reduction**:\n",
        "   - It uses t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of test set features from both SimCLR and Supervised models into two components, making them suitable for visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Visualization**:\n",
        "   - Two side-by-side scatter plots are created:\n",
        "     - The **left plot** shows the t-SNE visualization of test set features learned by the SimCLR model.\n",
        "     - The **right plot** shows the t-SNE visualization of test set features learned by the Supervised model.\n",
        "   - Each point represents a test image in the feature space, and points are color-coded based on their ground-truth labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Comparison**:\n",
        "   - By comparing the two plots, we can analyze:\n",
        "     - How well each method clusters similar test samples together.\n",
        "     - Whether features learned through SimCLR or Supervised training form distinct and meaningful groupings in the test set feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importance of t-SNE in This Context:\n",
        "- **Understanding Feature Quality**: It provides an intuitive way to evaluate how well the models separate test data points of different classes.\n",
        "- **Cluster Analysis**: Distinct and compact clusters in the test set indicate high-quality and generalizable feature representations.\n",
        "- **Comparison Tool**: It highlights differences between SimCLR and Supervised learning approaches in terms of their learned test set feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Questions to Consider:\n",
        "1. **How do the clusters in the t-SNE plots compare?**\n",
        "   - Are the clusters tighter and more distinct in one model's test set feature space than the other?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What does this tell you about the quality of features learned by SimCLR compared to Supervised learning on the test set?**\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Do you observe any overlap or poorly separated clusters in either plot? What might this indicate about the limitations of the corresponding model?**\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Based on the visualization of the test set features, which approach do you think generalizes better to unseen data, and why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Reflect on these questions as you analyze the t-SNE visualizations to better understand the differences between self-supervised and supervised learning on the test set.\n",

        "   - Create two instances of the `TSNE` class from `sklearn.manifold` for the two feature sets (`features1` and `features2`).\n",
        "   - Set `n_components=2` to reduce the dimensionality to 2D.\n",
        "   - Use the provided `random_state` argument to ensure reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reduce Features**:\n",
        "   - Use the `fit_transform` method of the t-SNE objects to transform the high-dimensional feature sets into 2D representations.\n",
        "   - Store the transformed features in `reduced_features1` and `reduced_features2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Hints:\n",
